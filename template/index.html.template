  Experts from both countries will present research on a broad spectrum of topics, including the physical, access, and higher communication layers, as well as core network infrastructure. The sessions will address subjects such as:
  <ul>
    <li>General visions of 6G standardization, and the French Priority Research Program and Equipment for Future Networks.</li>
    <li>Broadband cellular access and applications,</li>
    <li>Application of AI/ML in 6G networks</li>
    <li>Scheduling, multi-user access and random access</li>
    <li>Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces, IRS (theory, channel estimation, non-orthogonal multiple access, etc.)</li>
    <li>Coding, error-correction, and mathematical theories for communications,</li>
    <li>Integrated sensing and learning, quantum dots, NTN, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) communications.</li>

  </ul>

<p>
This workshop brings together cutting-edge advancements in wireless communication technologies, focusing on the future of 5G and 6G networks. Participants will explore key innovations such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), multi-user and mmWave communications, advanced channel estimation, interference models, non-coherent communication, non-orthogonal multiple access, random access, and integrated sensing and communication. A number of French lab visits are also scheduled.
</p>
<p>The event will focus on cutting-edge developments, including intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) for enhancing network efficiency, reinforcement learning for optimizing network management, and the impact of extended reality (XR) and the metaverse on future networks. 
Other topics will cover error-correcting codes, 5G performance analysis, and emerging technologies like delay-Doppler communication and quantum dots.</p>
