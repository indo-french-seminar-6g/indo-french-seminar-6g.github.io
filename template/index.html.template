<p>The Indo-French Seminar “6G Wireless Networks: Challenges and Opportunities” brings together cutting-edge advancements in wireless communication technologies, focusing on the future of 5G and 6G networks.
</p>
Funded by IFPCAR (CEFIPRA), it brings together 10 speakers originating from India and 10 speakers from France, in a program over 3 days, with the goal of initiating interactions among scientists and technologists of the two nations, and a number a participants.
<p>
This workshop brings together cutting-edge advancements in wireless communication technologies, focusing on the future of 5G and 6G networks. Participants will explore key innovations such as intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS), multi-user and mmWave communications, advanced channel estimation, interference models, non-coherent communication, non-orthogonal multiple access, random access, and integrated sensing and communication. A number of French lab visits are also scheduled.
</p>
<p>The event will focus on cutting-edge developments, including intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) for enhancing network efficiency, reinforcement learning for optimizing network management, and the impact of extended reality (XR) and the metaverse on future networks. 
Other topics will cover error-correcting codes, 5G performance analysis, and emerging technologies like delay-Doppler communication and quantum dots.</p>
